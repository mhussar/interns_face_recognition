NOTE: The code in this repo is only a POC that face recognition works with this implementation. It is not the final code indicated by the project summary below
# ü§ñ Face Recognition Kiosk with Voice Interaction

## üìå Overview

This project implements a smart kiosk capable of recognizing individuals, engaging them through natural conversation, and responding interactively via AI. It‚Äôs built initially for a Windows development environment, with deployment targeted on a Raspberry Pi for compact, standalone operation.

## üöÄ Features

* **Real-time Face Detection and Recognition**
* **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribes user's spoken name.
* **Interactive AI Conversation**: Utilizes Google Gemini (primary) and Qwen (fallback).
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generates audio responses using ElevenLabs.
* **Visual and Audible Interaction**: Responses displayed and spoken clearly.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Webcam detects a face.
2. **Recognition Check**: Determines if face is known.
3. **Prompt**: Politely requests the user‚Äôs name if unknown.
4. **Voice Input**: User verbally provides their name.
5. **Transcription**: Voice input converted to text.
6. **Storage**: Face and name saved to local SQLite database.
7. **AI Interaction**: User interaction sent to AI (Gemini/Qwen).
8. **AI Response**: AI-generated conversational reply.
9. **Audio Output**: Response vocalized via ElevenLabs.
10. **Visual Display**: Response simultaneously displayed on-screen.
